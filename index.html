    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img id="me" src="assets/images/por.jpg" alt="Picture of Taylor">
    <p>Hello! I'm Taylor Wood, and taking part in this course is the culmination of all of the efforts of my life.</p>
    <p>I was "unschooled," and unsocialized and hardly ever left the house as a kid, so when I left home at 15, </p>
    <p>I had a single skillset. Learn on your own. So I taught myself everything about life, and the world, and
      k-12, and managed to get into college.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed every moment of college that I experienced, but I need the ability to start a career now, so
      that I can achieve all of my goals</p>
    <p>in education, and coding, and game design, and music, and writting nerdy sci-fi/horror stories.</p>
    <p>I'm a socialphobe, and a nervous dude, but I never give up or stop trying. </p>
